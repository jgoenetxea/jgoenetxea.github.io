I received my M.S. degree in Informatics from Mondragon Unibertsitatea, Mondragon, Spain, in 2010. From 2010 to 2018 I work as a Researcher on computer vision and machine learning techniques of the Intelligent Transport Systems and Engineering Area of Vicomtech, San Sebastian, Spain. My current research interests include the automatic adjustment of 3D deformable graphical models to images, video-based face and body motion capture. I have participated in several international research and innovation projects, including developments of video-based face and body tracking techniques and automatic deformation of 3D models and the integration and the optimization of the developed methods into multiple software platforms (Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS).

I am also interested in computer graphics and virtual and augmented reality, but especially in everything related to the programming itself.
